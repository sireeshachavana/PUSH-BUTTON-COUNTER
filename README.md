*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*

*The main aim of this task is to count number of times tha pushbutton switch is pressed and display the count either on serial monitor or LCD display. I have used platform called tinkercad to implement the pushbutton counter using components like arduino, pushbutton switch, LCD display .We have to the coading to implement the pushbutton switch. According to the coading the tinkecad software will implement the project. It is similar with the arduino IDE software. In arduino IDE the hardware arduino is used and connected to the computer or personal computer through an USB cable.In tinkercad smart components are used for virtual simulation.A push button counter is a simple device, often used in conjunction with microcontrollers like Arduino, that increments a count each time a button is pressed. It typically consists of a physical push button that acts as a switch, and some form of electronic circuitry or code to register and display the count. Pushbutton switch is a mechanical or electronic switch that closes a circuit when pressed and opens it when released. This can be simple wiring to a microcontroller like Arduino, or more complex electronic components to register and display the count. The arduino consists of a inbuilt microcontroller. *
